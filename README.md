Penalized Smooth Hazard Models for Interval-Censored Data with
Applications to Survival and Illness-Death Models

This is an R-interface written by Ariane Bercu Gerds to a library of
Fortran functions developed by Pierre Joly, Celia Touraine and Thomas
Alexander

## Installation

You can install the development version of SmoothHazardoptim9 like so:

``` r
# FILL THIS IN! HOW CAN PEOPLE INSTALL YOUR DEV PACKAGE?
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

``` r
library(SmoothHazardoptim9)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`?
You can include R chunks like so:

``` r
summary(cars)
```

You’ll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md`
up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this.

You can also embed plots, for example:

<img src="man/figures/README-pressure-1.png" width="100%" />

In that case, don’t forget to commit and push the resulting figure
files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
