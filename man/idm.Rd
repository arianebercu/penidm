\arguments{
\item{formula01}{A formula specifying a regression model for the
\code{0 --> 1} transition from the initial state to the transient
state of the illness-death model.  The right hand side of the
formula specifies the covariate terms, and the left hand side must
be an event history object as returned by the function \code{Hist}.}

\item{formula02}{A formula specifying a regression model for the
\code{0 --> 2} transition from the initial state to the absorbing
state. The left hand side must be equal to the left hand side of
\code{formula01}. If missing it is set to \code{formula01}.}

\item{formula12}{A formula specifying a regression model for the
\code{1 --> 2} transition from the transient state to the absorbing
state.  operator is not required. If missing it is set to
\code{formula01}.}

\item{data}{A data frame in which to interpret the variables of
\code{formula01}, \code{formula02} and \code{formula12}.}

\item{method}{type of estimation method: "splines" for a likelihood approach with approximation of the transition
intensities by M-splines, "Weib" for a parametric approach with a
Weibull distribution on the transition intensities. Default is
"Weib".}

\item{scale.X}{do you want to center and reduce your explanatory variables}

\item{maxiter}{Maximum number of iterations. The default is 200.}

\item{maxiter.pena}{Maximum number of iterations for penalised coefficients}

\item{eps}{A vector of 3 integers >0 used to define the power of
three convergence criteria: 1. for the regression parameters,
2. for the likelihood, 3. for the second derivatives. The default
is \code{c(5,5,3)} which is translated into convergence if the
respective values change less then \eqn{10^{-5}} (for regression
parameters and likelihood) and \eqn{10^{-3}} for the second
derivatives between two iterations.}

\item{eps.spline}{the power of convergence for splines parameters only}

\item{eps.eigen}{the power of convergence for eigen values of covariance matrix only}

\item{n.knots}{For \code{method="splines"} only, a vector of length
3 specifing the number of knots, one for each transition, for the
M-splines estimate of the baseline intensities in the order \code{0
--> 1}, \code{0 --> 2}, \code{1 --> 2}. The default is c(7,7,7). When \code{knots}
are specified as a list this argument is ignored.
The algorithm needs least 5 knots and at most 20 knots.}

\item{knots}{Argument only active for the penalized likelihood approach \code{method="Splines"}.
There are three ways to control the placement of the knots between the smallest and the largest
of all time points:
\itemize{
 \item{\code{knots="equidistant"}}{Knots are placed with same distance on the time scale.}
 \item{\code{knots="quantile"}}{Knots are placed such that the number of observations is roughly the same between knots.}
\item{knots=list()}{List of 1 or 2 or three vectors. The list elements are the actual placements
(timepoints) of the knots for the M-spline. The list may contain
one vector of placements for each transition in the order \code{0 --> 1}, \code{0 --> 2}, \code{1 --> 2}.
If only vector is specifified the knots are used for all transitions. If only 2 vectors are specifified, the
knots for the \code{0 --> 1} transition are also used for the \code{1 --> 2} transition.}
}
The algorithm needs at least 3 knots in spline and allows no more than 20 knots.}

\item{type.quantile}{Argument only active for the likelihood approach \code{method="splines"}.
There are three ways to control the placement of the knots  according to the time considered between states :=
\itemize{
#'  \item{\code{type.quantile=1}}{Time for \code{0 --> 1} is the imputed to the middle of the interval left and right for demence . Time for \code{0 --> 2}
 and \code{1 --> 2} is the same t, time of news. }
 \item{\code{type.quantile=2}}{Time for \code{0 --> 1} is the imputed to the middle of the interval left and right. Time for \code{0 --> 2}
 and \code{1 --> 2} is the same t, time of news. }
\item{\code{type.quantile=3}}{Time for \code{0 --> 1} is the imputed to the middle of the interval left and right. Time for \code{0 --> 2}
 is time of death for non demented sujects only. Time for \code{1 --> 2} is time of death for suject diagnose with dementia. }
 #' \item{\code{type.quantile=4}}{Time for \code{0 --> 1} is left and right. Time for \code{0 --> 2}
 is time of death for non demented sujects only. Time for \code{1 --> 2} is time of death for suject diagnose with dementia. }
}}

\item{subset}{expression indicating the subset of the rows of data
to be used in the fit. All observations are included by default.}

\item{na.action}{how NAs are treated. The default is first, any
na.action attribute of data, second a na.action setting of options,
and third 'na.fail' if that is unset. The 'factory-fresh' default
is na.omit. Another possible value is NULL.}

\item{B}{vector of size the number of parameters, in the following order, first the parameters of splines \code{0 --> 1}, \code{0 --> 2}, \code{1 --> 2},
second the parameters of explanatory variables in order  \code{0 --> 1}, \code{0 --> 2}, \code{1 --> 2}.
This argument is only used for models with M-splines.}

\description{
Fit an illness-death model using either a semi-parametric approach
(penalized likelihood with an approximation of the transition intensity
functions by linear combination of M-splines) or a parametric approach
(specifying Weibull distributions on the transition intensities).
Left-truncated, right-censored, and interval-censored data are allowed.
State 0 corresponds to the initial state, state 1 to the transient one,
state 2 to the absorbant one. The allowed transitions are: 0 --> 1, 0 --> 2
and 1 --> 2.
}
\details{
The estimated parameters are obtained using the robust Marquardt algorithm
(Marquardt, 1963) which is a combination between a Newton-Raphson algorithm
and a steepest descent algorithm.
